# medical-records-cli
A CLI mockup for a medical records system, completed for 1st year Object-Orientated Programming in 2020.

## Features:
- Serialisation of user data using Boost library
- Management of delegated authority
- Integration with a text editor (Vim, emacs, etc) for viewing & editing medical records as text files

## Concepts that were used in the program:
- Polymorphism, inheritance and other key OO practicies integrated in the system's core functionality
- A basic CLI menu with input validation, not reliant on libraries like `ncurses`
- Filesystem integration using modern C++ STL and Boost alternatives
